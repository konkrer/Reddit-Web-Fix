  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective date: <strong>September 21, 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>This extension does not collect, transmit, or sell personally identifiable information to any external servers or third parties.</p>

  <h2>Data the extension uses</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Extension setting:</strong> a debug flag (boolean) saved to browser.storage.sync when you enable it via the Options page. This is stored by the browser and may be synchronized to your browser account.</li>
    <li><strong>In-memory state:</strong> vote state is tracked in-memory while the extension runs and is not uploaded to external services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How data is used</h2>
  <p>Saved settings are used to control debug logging. In-memory vote state is used only to keep UI vote highlights and counts consistent while browsing Reddit.</p>

  <h2>Third parties</h2>
  <p>No data is sent to third-party analytics or remote servers. All extension files are served locally from the extension package.</p>

  <h2>Data retention & deletion</h2>
  <p>Settings stored in browser.storage.sync remain until you clear them or uninstall the extension. To remove stored settings, either uninstall the extension or clear extension storage via your browser's extension/settings UI.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
